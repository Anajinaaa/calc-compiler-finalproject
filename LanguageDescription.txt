CALC Programming Language — Specification
-----------------------------------------

Overview
--------
CALC is a small programming language designed for simple mathematical scripting.
It supports variable assignment and print statements. CALC programs compile into
Python code using the included compiler.

Goals of CALC
-------------
- Extremely simple syntax
- Easy for beginners to read and write
- Demonstrates how compilers translate source code
- Focuses on arithmetic and expressions

Syntax Rules
------------

1. Variable Assignment
   Syntax:
       let <variable> = <expression>

   Examples:
       let x = 10
       let y = x + 5
       let z = (x * y) - 3


2. Print Statement
   Syntax:
       print <expression>

   Examples:
       print x
       print x + y
       print (x * 2) - 5


3. Expressions
   Expressions may use:
   - integers
   - variables
   - +, -, *, /
   - parentheses

   Examples:
       x + 10
       (x * 2) - 5
       a + b * (c - 1)

Program Structure
-----------------
A CALC program consists of one statement per line. Blank lines are ignored.

Compilation
-----------
Run:
    python compiler.py sample.calc output.py

This generates a Python file that can be executed normally.
